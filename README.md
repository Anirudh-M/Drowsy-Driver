# Drowsy-Driver
<p>According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, every year about 100,000 police-reported crashes involve drowsy driving. These crashes result in more than 1,550 fatalities and 71,000 injuries. The real number may be much higher, however, as it is difficult to determine whether a driver was drowsy at the time of a crash.</p>
<p>A study by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety estimated that 328,000 drowsy driving crashes occur annually. That's more than three times the police-reported number. The same study found that 109,000 of those drowsy driving crashes resulted in an injury and about 6,400 were fatal. The researchers suggest the prevalence of drowsy driving fatalities is more than 350% greater than reported.</p>
<p>This is a program to detect whether a driver is feeling sleepy while driving. The program takes input from a camera. The input is a continuous video stream of the driver's face while driving. When the driver closes eyes for more than a few seconds, a beep sound is made to wake the driver up.</p>
